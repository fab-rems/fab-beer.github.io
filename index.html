                    Did you know that increased self-confidence of a child is strongly correlated with positive outcomes in adolescent development and through adulthood?</p><p> Ongoing scientific research has continuously reveled the trememdous influence of youth self-esteem and in the earliest stages of development in shaping each of as we grow into actualized human beings... or sad human tragedies.

                <h3>BABY DICTATOR PROJECT</h3>   
                <p>
                This year, we heard that sad news that an endearing piece of artwork was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-for-stabbing-baby-trump-protest-balloon-at-alabama-lsu-game">attacked and destroyed at a rally in Alabama</a>.</p>
                <p>Pondering the sad occasion of this senseless brutality, we thought of the victim, the infantile and innocent personage of the future's would-be dictator-in-chief. It got us thinking about the senseless tragedy of a childhood of prickly inadequacy and the long-term consequences of a miserable upbringing on any human's mentality.
                    </p>

                <h3>100K CAN GOAL</h3>
                <p>The Baby Dictator Project (BDP) is to celebrate the beginning good of all human beings!</p>
                <p>Selling 100k cans, we will invest the profits from can sales to replace the fallen baby balloon one thousand times over! We will create artistic inflatables ready to roll out in every major city on the Trump 2020 rally-route! Recruiting rally supporters across the country, we will celebrate the innocence of young life in the form of positive, meaningful inflatables lent out for free to fans and floated over rallies, nationwide.</p>
               
                <h3>100M CAN GOAL</h3>
                <p>At a reach goal of 100M cans sold, proceeds will fund a time machine. We travel back to the year of his todderlhood and properly father the young man, giving the good roots of his natural human character the nutrition they need to grow up into a big strong tree, and be commander-in-chief or adult diaper model that we know he can be. We will be proud of him no matter what!
